to configure Apache2 on what directories it should access and other configuration
we can qucikly look up /etc/apache2/apache2.conf


<Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</directory>

/var/www/html : this shows that html folder is accessible with below functions attach to it.

for instance we can use apache to share files b/w systems, by putting the appropriate files in the /var/www/html folder 
and use wget or curl or other applications to download these files on the target system.

It is also possible to customize individual settings at the directory level by using the .htaccess file,
which we can create in the directory in question. This file allows us to configure certain directory-level settings,
such as access controls, without having to customize the Apache configuration file.
 We can also add modules to get features like mod_rewrite, mod_security, and mod_ssl that help us improve the security of our web application.



in addition sharing files can be also done via python server
